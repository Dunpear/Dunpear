I have been active in the web development field for four years, and for the past two years, I have been working
professionally in the industry.

- üåê  I have strong skills in implementing network-based projects and am well-versed in networking principles.
- ÷é   Currently, I am researching artificial intelligence and trying to steer my projects in that direction.
- üí°  Just coding isn‚Äôt enough to satisfy me. Most of the time, I aim to move projects forward with different architectures and structures
